# Books App

## Project Description
_**Books App**_ is a web app that allows users to search for books, as well as save them
and categorize them by currently reading, wish to read, and already read.
Users Can Also Get a visual representation, using a virtual library, and use
multiple visual bookshelves to represent book categories.

## Motivation
I created this app to keep track of my books, and I found it fun to use the virtual bookshelf tool, since other book applications just list them.
